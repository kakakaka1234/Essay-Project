      <article>
        <p> I have always been tall, decidedly tall.
            Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height.
            Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from “How heavy is the Earth?”
            to “Where does rain come from?” My curiosity,
            displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student.
            Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played 20Q (the
            <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/1f/2d/351f2d6a1d35cfc58a310f76e07d6800.jpg">electronic version</a>
            of Twenty Questions).
            Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking.
            The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q.
            This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life.</p>

        <h3>“Does it strive to learn?” “Yes.”</h3>
      <artical>
        <p>I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically, artificial neural networks—systems which learn and improve themselves. This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, and work over Cloud-based IDEs. I prized the freedom and the possibilities.</p>
